Classes and objects 
====================

* Classes and objects are organized in packages. In the same way that java does.

Imports come in several forms:
==============================

* import week3.Rational // imports just Rational
* import week3.{Rational, Hello} // Wildcard import. it imports both Rational and Hello. 
* import week3._ // imports everything in package week3


Require 
=======
require(y > 0, ”denominator must be positive”)

* require is used to enforce a precondition on the caller of a function.
* IllegalArgumentException will be thrown for require.


assert
=======
val x = sqrt(y)
assert(x >= 0)

* assert is used as to check the code of the function itself.
* AssertionError will be thrown  for assert,
