*) Tail recursion : Java doesn't perform tail call optimization. The majority of the Java dev ended resolving it with loop. 

*) Java 8 does not support Implicits etc.

*) Methods (functions!) everywhere. 
	- "Top-level", i.e. associated with the package
	- "Static" method in the Object instance instance
	- "Local method" inside a def method
	- Return type
	- function parameter.

*) Patter matching. Scala has Case classes for Patter matching "case class Person(firstName: String, lastName: String)"  Java doesn't

*) Java has not got for and yields statement.
        
*) Scala has val, def, lazy. Java everything is not final and it has not gor lazy.
 
*) Scala has trait where a class can mix in any number of traits. It also has simple abstrac classes. 

*) Scala has overloading of operators.  Java hasn't. 

*) Multi-line Strings Scala support and Java doesn't.
scala> val foo = """This is
    a multiline
    String"""

res0:This is
    a multiline
    String  

*) scala has an interpreter and java does not. In Scala you can create worksheet and in java not.  
  
*) Higher-order function: similar but we always have to use an Function object with apply.
*) we always have to use apply for currying in java.

Drawbacks of Scala Language:-
==============================

    Less Readable Code
    Bit tough to Understand the Code for beginners
    Complex Syntax to learn
    Less Backward Compatibility  

Diff
====

*) 
Scala is an Expression-Oriented Language: In Scala, everything is a value. All Expressions or Statements evaluates to a Value. 
We can assign Expression, Function, Closure, Object etc. to a Variable. 

Java is a Statement-Based Language: In Java, Statements are not Expressions or Values. We cannot assign them to a Variable. 
Java is not an Expression-Oriented Language. 

*) Scala function are first class citizen and in Java Object are first class citizen. 

*) Java Java achieve functional programming features by enclosing thing in objects for example Function 

*) In Scala everything is immutable by default.

*) Java tends to Uses getter and setter accessors to protect the integrity of a private attribute.

-In Scala  classes are immutable by default initialization can be done in the constructor using case Class in pattern matching.

Some features which are supported by Java, but not by Scala
===========================================================
    
* Java has Checked and Unchecked Exceptions, but Scala does not have Checked Exceptions.
* Scala does not support break and continue statements, but Java uses them.
* Scala does not have explicit Type casting, but Java supports this feature.    
* Java uses Primitive Data types, but Scala does not have.
* Java supports static members, but Scala does not have static members concept.
